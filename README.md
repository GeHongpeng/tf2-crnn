# Tensorflow 2 custom CRNN implementation

The project code is written as simply as I could. This is to make it easy to understand and debug. Also to get to know the tf2 keras module better.

1. [**Model.**](/crnn_model.py) The model definition and architecture.
2. [**Training.**](/train.py) Code for training.
3  [**Test.**](/test.py) Code for testing the pre-trained model.
4. [**Utils.**](/utils.py) All the utility functions used.

# TODO
1. pre-train the model on more data
2. show the results
